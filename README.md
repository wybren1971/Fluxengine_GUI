# Fluxengine_GUI
A GUI for the FluxEngine. Fluxengine is a very cheap USB floppy disk interface capable of reading and writing exotic non-PC floppy disk formats.
Fluxengine is created by David Given and you can find his fluxengine here https://github.com/davidgiven/fluxengine.
This GUI is a wrapper around fluxengine by David Given and doesn't work without this great peace of software.

This GUI is my first attempt to work with Qt Creator. The software is still in alpha stage.


The Fluxengine_GUI works with the latest fluxengine with protobuf.

In the directory Build1 is a directory DistrubutionKit. This directory contains everything to run Fluxengine_GUI on a Ubuntu 18.04 system (that's the only one i tested. Place this directory somewhere on your computer. Edit the Fluxengine_GUI.desktop file with the appropiate paths for your system.
Be sure that the fluxengine_GUI.sh is executable and has chmod +rx rights. Same applies for the Fluxengine_GUI in de /bin directory.

This software comes with no garuentees what so ever. I made this because i could use it.
I share it on github because i believe in opensource. You are welcome to contribute to this.
