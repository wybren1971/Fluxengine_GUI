# Fluxengine_GUI

27-6-2022 Update: Fluxengine_GUI is no longer maintained as fluxengine now includes a GUI, called fluxengine-gui.

A Graphical User Interface for the FluxEngine. Fluxengine is a very cheap USB floppy disk interface capable of reading and writing exotic non-PC floppy disk formats.
Fluxengine is created by David Given and you can find his fluxengine here https://github.com/davidgiven/fluxengine.
This GUI is a wrapper around fluxengine by David Given and doesn't work without this great peace of software.

This GUI is my first attempt to work with Qt Creator. The software is still in beta stage.

The Fluxengine_GUI works with the latest fluxengine with protobuf.

Just download the latest release. There is a linux and windows variant.

This software comes with no garuentees what so ever. I made this because i could use it.
I share it on github because i believe in opensource. You are welcome to contribute to this.

Some images to get an impression of the GUI...
